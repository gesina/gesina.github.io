I am *Gesina Schwalbe*, a researcher in the field of responsible artificial intelligence at [Continental AG][conti], Research and Advanced Engineering department.
In 2022 I received my doctoral degree from the [University of Bamberg][cogsys] for my [thesis][thesis] on methods for the safety assurance of deep neural networks (DNNs) in automotive computer vision, advised by [Prof. Dr. Ute Schmid][schmid].

By now my research interests are methods for assuring safe, secure, and ethical DNNs for computer vision, with a focus on using methods from explainable AI and uncertainty estimation.
One of the favorite projects I worked in regarding this is [KI-Absicherung](https://ki-absicherung.vdali.de/).
