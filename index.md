I am *Gesina Schwalbe*, currently a Ph.D. student at the 
[University of Bamberg][cogsys], 
working at [Continental AG][conti],
department Holistic Engineering and Technologies, Artificial
Intelligence, in the area of safety assurance for AI-based systems in
autonomous driving.
My research topic is formal verification of deep neural networks for
computer vision. For this I am developing quantifiable
localization and enforcement of visual semantic concepts based on
[Net2Vec](https://github.com/ruthcfong/net2vec) and
[TCAV](https://github.com/tensorflow/tcav).

My Ph.D. advisor is 
[Prof. Dr. Ute Schmid][schmid], 
head of department [Cognitive Systems][cogsys], University of Bamberg.
I am currently working in the publicly funded project
[KI-Absicherung](https://ki-absicherung.vdali.de/).
